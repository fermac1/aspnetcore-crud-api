## About this project

This project is a CRUD REST API built with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

I am a Laravel backend developer currently learning the .NET ecosystem.
The goal of this project is to understand:
- ASP.NET Core MVC
- Dependency Injection
- EF Core
- DTOs and validation
- RESTful API conventions
